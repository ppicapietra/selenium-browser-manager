## Description

The Selenium Browser Manager project is a Python package designed to simplify common operations in web scraping activities using Selenium. It aims to provide a convenient interface for automating browser actions while also offering access to more complex operations when needed and also a generation and managment of a dictionary for use in search engines.

## Key features

- **Simplified Automation:** The BrowserManager module streamlines the process of interacting with web pages by abstracting away the complexities of browser automation. It provides a high-level API that allows you to perform common tasks with ease, such as navigating to URLs, filling forms, clicking elements, and extracting data.

- **Safe Validation:** The BrowserManager module incorporates internal validation mechanisms to ensure a safer scraping experience. It handles various scenarios that commonly arise during web scraping, such as detecting and handling pop-ups, waiting for page elements to load, and managing timeouts. This reduces the need for manual validation and error handling in your scraping code.

- **Flexibility and Control:** While offering simplified automation, the BrowserManager module still provides access to the underlying Selenium functionality. This means you can leverage the full power of Selenium when you need to perform more advanced operations or customize the scraping process to your specific requirements.

- **Dictionary generator:** The DictionaryManager module offers a simple way to generate a dictionary to use in search engines, and extend any of them when you need less results matches.
